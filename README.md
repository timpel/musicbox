# musicbox
A Javascript app for making music. Give it a try at http://timwp.com/musicbox2/!

This is a little music editor for the web. You can loop playback, add tracks, add measures, change instruments, change key signatures, and save/share your creations. I made it as a personal learning project, and might expand on it in the future. It's built with JavaScipt, including jQuery and the Howler.js library (https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/).

sounds.js loads all the sounds used in the app as Howler.js sprites (Howls), while the rest of the javascript is run in script.js.

Icons inside buttons came from the very nice people at https://icons8.com/.
